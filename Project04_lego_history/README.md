This is an analysis of the history of LEGO sets releases and sales. The project is based on the dataset and investigation questions from DataCamp unguided project called "Exploring the History of Lego".
The main goal of the project was to analyze the popularity of Star Wars themed LEGO sets, namely: "uncovering the percentage of all licensed sets that are Star Wars themed" and "which year Star Wars was not the most popular set".
